abstract: >
  This working paper introduces an integrated hybrid modeling pipeline combining fuzzy graph neural networks (F-GNN), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and multi-objective optimization for adaptive water network control. The model addresses uncertainties due to partial SCADA blackout and proposes mechanisms for inferring missing hydraulic data. The framework was evaluated using a modified Walkerton EPANET model and synthetic fault scenarios. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating PINNs with fuzzy logic to maintain system observability and resilience during data loss.

summary: >
  A preprint presenting an adaptive hybrid GNN+PINN+fuzzy model for resilient water infrastructure under SCADA data loss.

This preprint builds upon the results of our previous published work on GIS-ANFIS-based accident prediction in water networks.

{{% callout warning %}}
Due to the critical nature of infrastructure data and the wartime conditions in Ukraine, **full access to source code and datasets is restricted**. Only general architecture and anonymized examples are shared publicly.

The proposed model includes:

- Fuzzy membership layers on top of graph node attributes
- Integration of PINN for physical constraint modeling (e.g., Darcyâ€“Weisbach)
- Compensation mechanisms for missing SCADA sensor inputs
- NSGA-II multi-objective optimization for valve control

This approach is applicable in utility AI systems that must remain resilient even during cyber-physical or war-induced infrastructure disruptions.
