abstract: >
  This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enhance monitoring and control in urban water supply systems. By integrating real-time SCADA signals and topological features of EPANET-modeled networks, the method achieves efficient leak detection, pressure anomaly forecasting, and explainability. A case study on the Walkerton water network demonstrates improvements in prediction accuracy and optimization of valve placement strategies using evolutionary search (NSGA-II).

summary: >
  Hybrid GNN-PINN models integrated with SCADA data improve real-time diagnostics and adaptive management of water supply networks.

The proposed approach demonstrates how hybrid neural architectures can be applied to real-world water infrastructure challenges. By combining graph topologies with physical modeling constraints and real-time sensor feedback, the framework bridges data-driven and physics-based modeling.

It supports operational decisions such as:

- Dynamic leak localization
- Adaptive pressure control
- Placement of smart valves and sensors
- Predictive failure analysis

Future work includes deployment of the system in collaboration with water utilities across Europe within the Horizon Europe framework.
