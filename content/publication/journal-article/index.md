abstract: >
  This article proposes a hybrid neuro-fuzzy model integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) to forecast accident locations in urban water supply networks. Combining ANFIS with genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization (ACO), the system allows spatiotemporal prediction with improved accuracy. The study was conducted using real data from Kyiv’s water infrastructure. Model performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R², achieving a forecast improvement of up to 11%. The hybrid approach demonstrates the potential for practical deployment in critical infrastructure monitoring.

summary: >
  A GIS-integrated hybrid AI model (ANFIS + GA + ACO) for spatial prediction of accidents in water supply networks.

The proposed hybrid system combines:

- **ANFIS**: for fuzzy logic and learning from data;
- **GA + ACO**: to optimize fuzzy rule sets and clustering;
- **GIS**: for spatial context, visualization, and decision support.

The integration supports water utilities in making informed, predictive decisions regarding accident response and preventive maintenance. Use of metaheuristics improved predictive power while retaining interpretability.
