summary: "Presentation of a hybrid AI framework combining GNNs, PINNs, and SCADA for real-time water distribution optimization and leak detection."

abstract: >
  In this talk, I presented a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), and real-time SCADA data to support digital twins for smart water distribution. The system enables anomaly detection, water quality simulation, and adaptive control using EPANET and GIS data. Applications include Kyivvodokanal and Hamburg Wasser.
