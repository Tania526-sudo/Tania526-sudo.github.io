Welcome to my research blog 

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## Vision

Water is life. Yet in many regions, aging infrastructure, climate change, and unpredictable consumer behavior challenge our ability to deliver it sustainably.

My mission is to develop **adaptive AI systems** that empower utilities, researchers, and communities to:
- detect leaks early,
- optimize hydraulic networks,
- model pollution and chlorination dynamics,
- and adapt in real time to behavioral disturbances.

## Research Topics

1. **Hybrid Graph Neural Networks (GNN) + Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** for real-time simulation and anomaly detection in water grids  
2. **Fractal geometry & metaheuristics** to optimize valve placement and zoning (DMA)  
3. **SCADA blackout simulation** using I-PINN + synthetic data  
4. **Water quality modeling** including disinfectant decay and pollutant tracking  
5. **Multi-agent systems with RL** for tariff-policy simulation and response  
6. **GeoAI and vector databases** for smart urban water analytics (Neo4j + PostGIS + SCADA + LangChain)
