Create a flexible, well-organized research environment tailored to your scientific workflows.

As a researcher working on hybrid AI models for critical water infrastructure, managing fragmented knowledge is essential. Hugo Blox gives you the freedom to build a **second brain**: your personal knowledge base — either private or public — powered by clean Markdown and GitHub versioning.

Use it to store ideas, document pipelines, track experiments, and share results. Whether you’re preparing a Horizon Europe proposal, modeling with PINNs and GNNs, or just noting insights during fieldwork, everything stays structured and accessible.

## Mindmaps

To structure your thinking, Hugo Blox supports **interactive mindmaps** via the `markmap` Markdown extension.

You can write maps as simple lists, embed equations, link to code repositories, or even reference SCADA patterns or EPANET node logic — all in one visual hierarchy.

Example:

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Research Pipeline
  - Data Sources
    - SCADA
    - EPANET (.inp)
    - GeoJSON
  - AI Models
    - GNN
