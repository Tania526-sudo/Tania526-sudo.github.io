  abstract  = {This study presents a hybrid AI model based on ANFIS enhanced with genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization (ACO), integrated into a GIS for spatiotemporal prediction of accidents in urban water networks. The system was tested on real-world data from Kyiv, Ukraine. Forecast accuracy improved by up to 11%, making the approach promising for smart city utilities.},
